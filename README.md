## Images in data

1_2.png - Mosaic image with different aperture and focal settings from the lightfield.

Images with different focal depths
- 1_3_intergrated_2.png  
- 1_3_intergrated_5.png         
- 1_3_intergrated_0.png  
- 1_3_intergrated_3.png           
- 1_3_intergrated_1.png  
- 1_3_intergrated_4.png     

Infocus images generated using different params

- 1_4_all_infocus_1_10.png
- 1_4_all_infocus_0.7_50.png
- 1_4_all_infocus_0.7_5.png

1_4_depth_0.7_5.png - Depth image derived from focal stack

1_5.png - Mosaic image with different AFI

1_5_depth_confocal.png - Depth image derived from confocal sterio

2_1.mp4 - Video for unstructured lightfield

## Running the code 
To run the first part of the assignment run the following line:
Params that can be changed are depths, apertures, sigma_1, sigma_2 
(notations same as that in the assignment)

```
python q1.py
```

To run the second part of the assignment make sure that "folder" variable points to a folder with 
frames of the video.
```
python q2.py

```
